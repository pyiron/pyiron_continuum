class RectMesh(HasStorage):
    """
    A helper class for building rectangular meshgrids in n-dimensions.
    **Assumes periodic boundary conditions.**
    Mesh corresponds to numpy meshgrid with `indexing='ij'` *not* the default `'xy'` indexing. This gives consistency
    in behaviour for meshes in >2 dimensions.

    Example 1-D)

    >>> mesh = RectMesh(2, 2, simplify_1d=True)
    >>> mesh.mesh
    array([0., 1.])
    >>> mesh.steps
    array(1.)

    Example 2-D)
    >>> mesh = RectMesh(bounds=[[0, 1], [2, 5]], divisions=[2, 3])
    >>> mesh.mesh
    array([[[0. , 0. , 0. ],
            [0.5, 0.5, 0.5]],
    <BLANKLINE>
           [[2. , 3. , 4. ],
            [2. , 3. , 4. ]]])
    >>> mesh.steps
    array([0.5, 1. ])

    Note: To get a 1D mesh starting somewhere other than 0, you need an extra set of brackets, i.e.
    `bounds=[[start, end]]` as simply using `[start, end]` will actually give you a 2D array `[[0, start], [0, end]]`!

    Attributes:
        bounds (numpy.ndarray): The start and end point for each dimension.
        divisions (numpy.ndarray): How many sampling points in each dimension, i.e. the shape of a scalar field.
        dim (int): The dimensionality of the field.
        shape (tuple): The shape of the mesh, i.e. the shape of a vector field.
        mesh (numpy.ndarray): The spatial sampling points.
        steps (numpy.ndarray/float): The step size in each dimension.
        lengths (numpy.ndarray/float): How large the domain is in each dimension.
        volume (float): The product of the lengths in all dimensions.
        accuracy (int): An even value given the number of stencil points to use in each dimension for calculating
            derivatives. (Default is 4.)
        simplify_1d (bool): Whether to reduce dimension whenever the first dimension is redundant, e.g. [[1,2]]->[1,2].

    Methods:
        derivative: Calculate the nth order derivative of a scalar field to get a vector field.
        grad: Calculate the first derivative of a scalar field to get a vector field.
        div: Calculate the divergence of a vector field to get a scalar field.
        laplacian: Calculate the Laplacian of a scalar field to get a scalar field.
        curl: Calculate the curl of a vector field to get a vector field. (Only for 3d!)

    Note: All the mathematical operations can take either a numpy array of the correct dimension *or* a callable that
        takes the mesh itself as an argument and returns a numpy array of the correct dimension, where 'correct' is
        refering to scalar field (mesh divisions) or vector field (mesh shape).

    Warning: Operations over the actual mesh points are all nicely vectorized, but this is by no means highly optimized
        for numeric efficiency! If you want to do some really heavy lifting, this is probably the wrong tool.

    TODO: Include aperiodic boundary conditions, e.g. padding. Probably by modifying the decorators.
